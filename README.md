# Manifesto on biocultural diversity

According to the 2019 [United Nations report on biodiversity](https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/blog/2019/05/nature-decline-unpreced), the world will lose one million species in the upcoming years. In parallel, it is acknowledged that the degradation of biological diversity directly affects negatively cultural and linguistic diversity, [as declared by UNESCO](http://www.unesco.org/new/en/culture/themes/endangered-languages/biodiversity-and-linguistic-diversity/). Today, a third of the world’s languages have fewer than 1,000 speakers left, and a majority of those languages are predicted to disappear by the next century. Culture is linked and influenced by locally specific relationships between people and the environment, resulting in varied values, knowledge and practices related to biodiversity (in a variety of life forms including genes, species, ecosystems), while in parallel biodiversity conservation is expressed using words and vocabulary through the social genes of culture.

In this manifesto we recognize that biodiversity and cultural diversity are intimately related and interconnected. [According to recent research](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/global-sustainability/article/from-local-landscapes-to-international-policy-contributions-of-the-biocultural-paradigm-to-global-sustainability/858B95277512916D4A2526A7FF7739A1), there is a significant decline in biocultural diversity across the globe. Even though several nations have implemented laws and strategies for the protection of existing biodiversity. We, the undersignants, do not consider this a sufficient cause of action. We also state that there is urgency to act in front of a correlated loss of languages and cultural diversity across the globe. 

The following manifesto is an attempt to show the ways in which we make these connections concrete, and develop ways in which we can positively contribute to preserving the complexity of communities around us towards a sustainable future, a world where many worlds co-exist. For this, we need to address the systemic connections between the global and local scales of biocultural diversity loss.

If cultural practices and knowledge systems transmitted through language and linguistic cultures impact either positively or negatively, our approaches to preservation of the earth’s resources and our biodiversity, we will have to transform cultural practices and develop a language of sustainability and coexistence that have a chance of positive outcomes.

## Economy and the environment

Human and nature are interconnected, as well as the way humans position themselves in the world. Understanding the interconnectedness of nature and society is critical to dealing with a changing world, adapting to it and managing for resilience. The current economic system is a system of extraction that does not envision an end to our resources. The accumulative effects of this extractionism affect biocultural diversity. Moreover, it denies seeing ourselves as species and part of the ecosystem.

Governments, public and private entities and the entire society need to be accountable for their actions, transparent about their practices and switch to new visions and positive strategies. They need to care about the materiality of natural resources, the meanings and narratives of these materials for different cultures. For this specific challenge, we propose: 

* Create a production-related label for cultural diversity and biodiversity (for example comparing indigineous and preserved land valances in relation to monocultures, or diversity of people’s cultures and backgrounds in companies).
* Create specific template programs for organizations to become labelled, after practical actions in terms of preserving biodiversity and cultural diversity.
* Formalize a broad biocultural diversity definition and a quantitative index accordingly (building up on existing indexes like Entropy, Shannon Index, Simpson Index, Berger-Parker, etc).
* Promote research on the redistribution and cost of biocultural preservation into the price of final products (cultural products, commodities, food, etc).
* Develop policies for preserving the cultural standpoints of stakeholders in a sustainable economic negotiation, making sure no ecosystem is left out with a representative culture. 
* Incentivize private and public organizations for adopting the [UN’s Sustainable Development Goals](https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/sustainable-development-goals/) related to biocultural diversity.
* Explore the viability of how biosystem impact, redistribution, governance and taxation could be embedded into new crypto-currencies.
* Promote and contribute to research and documentation of global initiatives on biocultural diversity for replicating practices in other places.
* Create concrete actions of interaction and dialogue in local environments.

## Education and awareness 

In today’s society, there is a pressing need to foster the understanding, awareness and critical reflection of the interplay with culture and language related to diversity, and in this sense education is key to reach across generations. Education as a structural and social process should not be understood as a vertical operation (‘knowledge holders’ vs. ‘knowledge demanders’), but as a horizontal and shared circulation of practices and knowledge, including every individual and every group, regardless of their situation in society. In our understanding, education is a means of sharing practices and knowledge in a collaborative and a transcontextual ethics approach. In this perspective, increasing awareness on diversity by means of education is a must, as it needs to be understood as a given that can be beneficial as part of every citizen’s education.

Education also is to be connected to the notion of transmission, especially the transmission of diverse practices and knowledge already existing within different cultural and social groups, including indigenous people -and not only limited to scholars, teachers or people who are perceived as legitimate by systems of accreditation and acknowledgement. In this sense, wider awareness on biological, cultural and linguistic diversity involves several different stakeholders. The main concepts addressed by education and awareness around biocultural diversity are the following, rooted in a balanced approach:

* Diversity - biological, cultural, linguistic -  should be introduced in the curriculum in order to foster diversity in its complex reality, mixing anthropology, agriculture, ecology, environmental studies and social studies. 
* It is key to target children as well as adults and all kinds of groups with education methods adapted to the reality and needs of every population regarding the support of biocultural diversity. 
* In this regard it is also urgent to develop new programmes, curricula and content conceived and presented in a collaborative way, through a variety of methods, tools, approaches and contents.
* Alternative learning methods are to be fostered: immersive experiences, mutual visits, workshops, games, sustainable technology that have to be ethically used within an environmental-centered approach. 
* Regarding learning environments, schools and education spaces should be designed according to sustainability needs and reflecting local biocultural diversity. Also the process of learning should take part outside of school and other education spaces, when possible, so that experiences on biodiversity and culture happen in an environment surrounded by things that should be learned, conserved, preserved, supported and developed further.
* External stakeholders have to be invited to contribute to educational and awareness programmes, philosophies and realities.
* Since visual aspects are very important for the promotion and transmission of ideas regarding biocultural diversity, ideas and concepts based on interactive technologies should be supported for inspirational artwork and research.
* Education is here to be conceived as a means to foster, maintain and disseminate the idea of diversity as something positive, necessary to preserve, to engage with and to support.
* Education is also about learning how to share agency and caring among citizens, to be aware of the inherent systemic complexity and interconnective nature of diversity, and to know about the representations and views of the world that circulate within societies.
* A respectful balance between education and transmission needs also the analysis and questioning of meaning in the broad sense of the word: biases, archetypes, symbols, representations and stereotypes.
* Another key is the study and dissemination of concepts of balance and homeostasis, in order to understand and conceptualize the link between human societies and their environment.

## Contributors

The first version of this manifesto was the result of a [collaborative writing "sprint" held at exploration space at the Austrian Academy of Sciences](https://www.oeaw.ac.at/acdh/about/news-archive/news-detail/workshop-biodiversity-in-connection-with-linguistic-and-cultural-diversity) on 23-24 October 2019 in Vienna. It reflects the discussions, agreements, views and perspectives during a content co-creation process by a diverse group of people who engaged in the first version of this document. We met and worked together during two days sharing complementary knowledge from the fields of biology, linguistics, humanities, sustainability, sociology, design and computer sciences. As participants we were representing different institutions as academic researchers, practitioners and cultural activists with procedences from Austria, Brasil, El Salvador, France, Germany, India, Mexico, Portugal, Spain, Sweden. We reflect here the results of the manifesto sprint after a second stage of online writing and collaboration open to more participants.
